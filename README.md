# Got It, Get It, Code It!

## Description

This website contains a quiz on coding and will test one's knowledge of initial coding concepts.  This website was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Many challenges were faced regarding the JavaScript itself, especially with the actual quiz portion.  In the future, I would like to make this website better by adding a high scores element as well as a timer.
